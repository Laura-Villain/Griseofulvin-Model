The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of Griseofulvin in adults.
A high variability in the pharmacokinetics of oral Griseofulvin was observed between patients in the clinical studies, making it difficult to find parameters that would fit well each subject. 
Such a variability needs to be taken into account for the simulation of the pharmacokinetics of Griseofulvin in patients.
