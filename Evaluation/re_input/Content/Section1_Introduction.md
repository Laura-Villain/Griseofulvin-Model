The presented model building and evaluation report describes the development of a PBPK model for griseofulvin in healthy adults.

Griseofulvin is an orally administered antifungal agent used to treat skin and nail infections. 
It acts by disrupting microtubule function, thereby inhibiting fungal cell division. 
The compound selectively accumulates in keratin-producing tissues, providing localized antifungal activity.

Griseofulvin exhibits variable oral absorption, with bioavailability influenced by formulation and food intake. 
Peak plasma concentrations are typically observed within 4 to 8 hours. 
After absorption, the drug distributes broadly into skin, liver, fat, and muscle. 
It is extensively metabolized in the liver, with elimination occurring through both urine and feces. 
The terminal half-life ranges from 9 to 24 hours.

The presented Griseofulvin PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Griseofulvin-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Griseofulvin-Model)).
